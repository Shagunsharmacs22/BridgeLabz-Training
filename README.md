📋 📌 Day 1 – 16 December 2025

On the first day, I officially started the Bridgelabz Training Program for Capgemini. The focus of the session was on building a strong foundational understanding of the tools and practices required for the training.

 1.Introduction to the Java development environment, including setup and configuration

 2.Overview of Git and GitHub, covering basics of version control and repository management

 3. Understanding code tracking and collaboration using Git

 4.Explanation of project structure and coding standards to ensure clean, organized, and maintainable code

📋 📌 Day 2 – 17 December 2025

On the second day of training, the focus was on organizing the project in a structured and maintainable manner for Core Java practice.

1.Created the initial folder structure for the training project

2.Organized all Java practice under the core-java-practice directory

3.Maintained a structured codebase inside the gcr-codebase folder

4.Created separate folders for different learning modules:

   #Programming Elements

   #Control Flow

   #LeetCode practice

   #Scenario-based problems

5.Ensured clarity, scalability, and proper organization of the project structure

📋 📌 Day 3 – 18 December 2025

On the third day of training, I completed the Level 1 and Level 2 assignments related to Programming Elements, focusing on strengthening the core fundamentals of Java programming.

1.Completed Level 1 and Level 2 assignments of Programming Elements

2.Practiced core concepts of variables and data types

3.Worked with operators for data manipulation

4.Implemented input and output operations in Java

5.Improved understanding of basic Java syntax and structure

6.Learned how data is stored, processed, and displayed in Java programs

7.Organized all completed assignments inside
  ===core-java-practice/gcr-codebase/programming-elements

📋 📌 Day 4 – 19 December 2025

On the fourth day of training, I completed the Level 1 and Level 2 assignments for the Control Flow module, focusing on implementing decision-making and looping logic in Java programs.

1.Completed Level 1 and Level 2 assignments of the Control Flow module

2.Practiced conditional statements including if, if-else, and switch

3.Worked with looping constructs such as for, while, and do-while

4.Developed logical and efficient programs to control the flow of execution

5.Implemented an example program DivisibilityByFive.java to demonstrate conditional logic

6.Organized all Control Flow assignments inside
   ===core-java-practice/gcr-codebase/control-flow
